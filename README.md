# Girg-Jump-Notifier

This application will help players during Girgashiy raids. A message will be displayed whenever Girgashiy begins to jump, and a counter of the number of Shield of Trust skills have been used. The Girgashiy and other players who are using Shield of Trust must be loaded (in range) for the program to identify that those actions have occured. A packet proxy must be used ([Morrighan](http://aura-project.org/forum/topic/40-morrighan-client-proxy-updated-2015-12-13-v156/)).

## Usage
1. Load Mabi while using Morrighan.
2. Launch the Girg Jump Notifier.
3. Press the Connect button. The Morrighan window will light up if the connection is successful.
4. Do Girgashiy.
5. Press the Disconnect button and close the program (although this doesn't seem to be necessary).
